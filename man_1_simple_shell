.SH NAME
.B BombShell, hsh - a command language interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.I hsh [command] [arg] ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
BombShell (hsh) replicates the command language interpreter (sh) and executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.\


.SH OVERVIEW
Bombshell (hsh) is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes the commands.\
It is a program that is running when the user compiles BombShell (simple_shell) and runs the executable file, ./hsh. \
BombShell implements a language that has flow control constructs, steering the computer to execute the commands. It incorporates\
features for interactive use and has the advantage of being in non-interactive mode, allowing the user to pipe commands into hsh such as echo "ls" | ./hsh\
That is, commands can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put into a file and the file can be executed directly by the shell.

.SH INVOCATION
To start up BombShell, you must first compile with gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh and run the executable ./hsh.
If no arguments are present and if the standard input of the shell is connected to a terminal, the shell is considered in interactive mode .
BombShell is designed to interact in Linux or a Unix like system since the shell uses the Linux system calls to retrieve and execute executable programs found in the $PATH. Our version of the shell incorporates the builtin commands "exit" and "env".
